        <p>
            MoLenerzi is a sustainability-driven platform built to support Small and Medium Enterprises
            in improving efficiency, reducing waste, cutting emissions, and strengthening resilience.
            Many SMEs lack the tools or resources to measure their environmental footprint or operate
            efficiently — we aim to change that with simple, AI-powered solutions.
